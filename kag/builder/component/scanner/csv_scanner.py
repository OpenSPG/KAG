    A class for reading CSV files and converting them into a list of dictionaries.

    This class inherits from `ScannerABC` and provides functionality to read CSV files.
    It can either return the entire row as a dictionary or split the row into multiple dictionaries
    based on specified columns.

    Attributes:
        cols (List[str]): A list of column names to be processed. If None, the entire row is returned as a dictionary.
        rank (int): The rank of the current process (used for distributed processing).
        world_size (int): The total number of processes (used for distributed processing).

        Initializes the CSVScanner with optional columns, rank, and world size.

        Args:
            cols (List[str], optional): A list of column names to be processed. Defaults to None.
                - If not specified, each row of the CSV file will be returned as a single dictionary.
                - If specified, each row will be split into multiple dictionaries, one for each specified column.
            rank (int, optional): The rank of the current process. Defaults to None.
            world_size (int, optional): The total number of processes. Defaults to None.
