# KAG Example: CSQA

The [UltraDomain](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TommyChien/UltraDomain/tree/main)
``cs.jsonl`` dataset contains 10 documents in Computer Science and
100 questions with their answers about those documents.

Here we demonstrate how to build a knowledge graph for those documents,
generate answers to those questions with KAG and compare KAG generated
answers with those from other RAG systems.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Follow the Quick Start guide of KAG to install the OpenSPG server and KAG.

   The following steps assume the Python virtual environment with KAG installed
   is activated and the current directory is [csqa](.).

2. (Optional) Download [UltraDomain](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TommyChien/UltraDomain/tree/main)
   ``cs.jsonl`` and execute [generate_data.py](./generate_data.py) to generate data files in
   [./builder/data](./builder/data) and [./solver/data](./solver/data). Since the generated files
   were committed, this step is optional.

   ```bash
   python generate_data.py
   ```

3. Update the ``openie_llm``, ``chat_llm`` and ``vectorizer_model`` configurations
   in [kag_config.yaml](./kag_config.yaml) properly.
   The ``splitter`` and ``num_threads_per_chain`` configurations may also be updated
   to match with other systems.

4. Restore the KAG project.

   ```bash
   knext project restore --host_addr http://127.0.0.1:8887 --proj_path .
   ```

5. Commit the schema.

   ```bash
   knext schema commit
   ```

6. Execute [indexer.py](./builder/indexer.py) in the [builder](./builder) directory to build the knowledge graph.

   ```bash
   cd builder && python indexer.py && cd ..
   ```

7. Execute [eval.py](./solver/eval.py) in the [solver](./solver) directory to generate the answers.

   ```bash
   cd solver && python eval.py && cd ..
   ```

   The results are saved to ``./solver/data/csqa_kag_answers.json``.

8. (Optional) Follow the LightRAG [Reproduce](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG?tab=readme-ov-file#reproduce)
   steps to generate answers to the questions and save the results to
   [./solver/data/csqa_lightrag_answers.json](./solver/data/csqa_lightrag_answers.json).
   Since a copy was committed, this step is optional.

9. Update the LLM configurations in [summarization_metrics.py](./solver/summarization_metrics.py)
   and [factual_correctness.py](./solver/factual_correctness.py)
   and execute them to get the metrics.

   ```bash
   python ./solver/summarization_metrics.py
   python ./solver/factual_correctness.py
   ```

10. (Optional) To delete checkpoints, execute the following commands.

    ```bash
    rm -rf ./builder/ckpt
    rm -rf ./solver/ckpt
    ```

    To delete the KAG project and related knowledge graph, execute the following similar command.
    Replace the OpenSPG server address and KAG project id with actual values.

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8887/project/api/delete?projectId=1
    ```
