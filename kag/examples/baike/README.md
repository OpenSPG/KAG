# KAG Example: BaiKe

[English](./README.md) |
[简体中文](./README_cn.md)

## 1. Precondition

Please refer to [Quick Start](https://openspg.yuque.com/ndx6g9/cwh47i/rs7gr8g4s538b1n7) to install KAG and its dependency OpenSPG server, and learn about using KAG in developer mode.

## 2. Steps to reproduce

### Step 1: Enter the example directory

```bash
cd kag/examples/baike
```

### Step 2: Configure models

Update the generative model configurations ``openie_llm`` and ``chat_llm`` and the representive model configuration ``vectorizer_model`` in [kag_config.yaml](./kag_config.yaml).

You need to fill in correct ``api_key``s. If your model providers and model names are different from the default values, you also need to update ``base_url`` and ``model``.

### Step 3: Project initialization

Initiate the project with the following command.

```bash
knext project restore --host_addr http://127.0.0.1:8887 --proj_path .
```

### Step 4: Commit the schema

Execute the following command to commit the schema [BaiKe.schema](./schema/BaiKe.schema).

```bash
knext schema commit
```

### Step 5: Build the knowledge graph

Execute [indexer.py](./builder/indexer.py) in the [builder](./builder) directory to build the knowledge graph.

```bash
cd builder && python indexer.py && cd ..
```

### Step 6: Execute the QA tasks

Execute [eval.py](./solver/eval.py) in the [solver](./solver) directory to ask demo questions and view the answers and trace logs.

```bash
cd solver && python eval.py && cd ..
```

### Step 7: (Optional) Cleanup

To delete the checkpoints, execute the following command.

```bash
rm -rf ./builder/ckpt
```

To delete the KAG project and related knowledge graph, execute the following similar command. Replace the OpenSPG server address and KAG project id with actual values.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8887/project/api/delete?projectId=1
```
