INFO:root:question: what is the percentage change in the total fair value of non-vested shares from 2009 to 2010?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What was the total fair value of non-vested shares in 2010?
The total fair value of non-vested shares in 2010 was $29,946.

**Reasoning and Original Text:**
The document states that at the end of fiscal year 2010, 713 shares were non-vested with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $42. To calculate the total fair value, multiply the number of non-vested shares by the weighted average grant-date fair value:
713 shares * $42 = $29,946.

INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What is the total fair value of non-vested shares in 2009?
$31,944

**Reasoning and Original Text:**
The total fair value of non-vested shares in 2009 is calculated by multiplying the number of non-vested shares at the end of fiscal year 2009 (762 shares) by their weighted average grant-date fair value ($42). This information is provided in the document: 

*"At the end of fiscal year 2009, 762 shares were non-vested with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $42."*

Calculation: 762 shares * $42 = $31,944.

INFO:root:question: what was the decrease in rental expense ( millions ) for operating leases in continuing operations from 2003 to 2003?
INFO:root:question: What were the rental expenses for operating leases in continuing operations in 2003?
INFO:root:question: What financial reports or disclosures from 2003 provide details on operating lease expenses for continuing operations?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What specific financial reports or disclosures from 2003 (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) provide details on operating lease expenses for continuing operations?
The 10-K and 10-Q reports from 2003 would provide details on operating lease expenses for continuing operations. Specifically, the 10-K report would include the future minimum lease commitments for 2003, which were reported as $30 million in total, with $4 million allocated to discontinued operations, as disclosed in the Future Minimum Lease Commitments as of December 31, 2002.

**Reasoning and Original Text:**
The Future Minimum Lease Commitments as of December 31, 2002, show that the lease commitment for the year 2003 was $30 million in total, with $4 million for discontinued operations. This information would typically be carried forward into the 2003 10-K and 10-Q reports. 

**Original Text:**
```

```
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_1: Where in these financial reports (e.g., notes to the financial statements, MD&A) are operating lease expenses typically disclosed?
Operating lease expenses are typically disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

**Reasoning and Original Text Reference:**
The provided documents mention rental expenses for operating leases in the context of financial reporting.

INFO:root:question: what was average worldwide net acreage expiring in the total three year period , in millions?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What was the total worldwide net acreage expiring in each of the three years?
The total worldwide net acreage expiring was 586 thousand acres in 2014, 3057 thousand acres in 2015, and 236 thousand acres in 2016.

### Reasoning:
The document explicitly states the worldwide net undeveloped acreage expiring for each of the three years:
- 586 thousand acres in 2014,
- 3057 thousand acres in 2015,
- 236 thousand acres in 2016.

INFO:root:question: if 2014 underlying operating profit increases at the same pace as 2013 , what would it be , in millions?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What was the underlying operating profit for 2012?
The underlying operating profit for 2012 was $2014M.

**Reasoning:**  
The document `#f6e914e660f1b05d749bba211db2822b.md / Financial Metrics with Adjustments for Mark-to-Market and Project K Costs (2011-2013)` explicitly states the underlying operating profit values for 2013, 2012, and 2011 as $2098M, $2014M, and $2109M respectively. The value for 2012 is directly provided as $2014M.  

**Original Text:**  
"Underlying operating profit values for 2013, 2012, and 2011 are $2098M, $2014M, and $2109M respectively."
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_1: What was the underlying operating profit for 2013?
The underlying operating profit for 2013 was $2098M.

**Reasoning and Original Text Referenced:**
The value for the underlying operating profit for 2013 is explicitly stated in the document `#f6e914e660f1b05d749bba211db2822b.md` under the section "Financial Metrics with Adjustments for Mark-to-Market and Project K Costs (2011-2013)". The table provided includes the following row:

```

INFO:root:question: what is the maximum depreciation rate that can be used for furniture fixtures and equipment?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What is the maximum depreciation rate for furniture, fixtures, and equipment under the relevant tax or accounting standards?
The maximum depreciation rate for furniture, fixtures, and equipment is 33.33% per year.

**Reasoning and Original Text:**
The estimated useful life for furniture, fixtures, and equipment is stated to be 3 to 10 years. The maximum depreciation rate would correspond to the shortest useful life, which is 3 years. Using straight-line depreciation, the annual depreciation rate is calculated as 100% divided by the useful life. Therefore, for a 3-year useful life, the annual depreciation rate is 33.33%.

**Original Text Reference:**
`| furniture fixtures and equipment | 3 - 10  |` from the table titled "Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment for Dollar General Corporation."

INFO:root:question: what was total acres expiring in millions for other africa?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What is the total number of acres expiring in millions for the "other Africa" category?
2.983 million acres.

**Reasoning:**  
The total number of acres expiring in the "other Africa" category for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 is provided in thousands: 189 (2014), 2605 (2015), and 189 (2016). Summing these values gives 2983 thousand acres, which is equivalent to 2.983 million acres.

**Original text referenced:**  
"Other Africa had 189, 2605, and 189 thousand net undeveloped acres expiring in 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively."

INFO:root:question: in the table , what percentage of total aus net inflows for 2017 were long- term aus liquidity products?
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_0: What are the total Australian net inflows for 2017?
The total Australian net inflows for 2017 were $18 billion.

**Reasoning and Original Text Reference:**
The documents indicate that in 2017, there were $23 billion of inflows ($20 billion in long-term assets and $3 billion in liquidity products) related to the acquisition of a portion of Verus Investors' outsourced chief investment officer business. Additionally, there were $5 billion of equity asset outflows due to the divestiture of local Australian-focused investment capabilities and fund platform. Therefore, the net inflows for 2017 are calculated as $23 billion (inflows) minus $5 billion (outflows), resulting in $18 billion.

Original Text: "total aus net inflows/ ( outflows ) for 2017 included $ 23 billion of inflows ( $ 20 billion in long- term aus and $ 3 billion in liquidity products ) in connection with the acquisition of a portion of verus investors 2019 outsourced chief investment officer business ( verus acquisition ) and $ 5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the divestiture of our local australian- focused investment capabilities and fund platform ( australian divestiture ) ."
INFO:root:sub_qa_pair_1: What is the portion of total Australian net inflows for 2017 that were long-term Australian liquidity products?
The portion of total Australian net inflows for 2017 that were long-term Australian liquidity products was **$20 billion out of $23 billion**.

**Reasoning and Original Text:**
The document states that "total aus net inflows/(outflows) for 2017 included $23 billion of inflows ($20 billion in long-term aus and $3 billion in liquidity products)." This directly provides the figures needed to answer the question.

**Reference:**
`#GS/2018/page_78.pdf-4#GS/2018/page_78.pdf-4 and subsidiaries management 2019s discussion and analysis in the table above , total aus net inflows/ ( outflows ) for 2017 included $ 23 billion of inflows ( $ 20 billion in long- term aus and $ 3 billion in liquidity products ) in connection with the acquisition of a portion of verus investors 2019 outsourced chief investment officer business ( verus acquisition ) and $ 5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the divestiture of our local australian- focused investment capabilities and fund platform ( australian divestiture ).`
