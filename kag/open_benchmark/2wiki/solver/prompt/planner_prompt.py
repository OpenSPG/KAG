The `query` field contains a complex multi-hop question that can be broken down into a series of simple single-hop questions. Your task is to carefully analyze the logical structure of the question, then decompose the multi-hop question into a series of single-hop atomic questions, and provide the dependencies between these sub-questions. The dependencies should be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
  
Decompose the original multi-hop question into a series of single-hop atomic questions and carefully analyze their dependencies, representing them in the form of a DAG. If Question 2 depends on Question 1, then the answer to Question 1 must be explicitly referenced within Question 2.
  
Please complete the task according to the following rules:
1. Atomic Decomposition:
   - Break down the multi-hop question in the `query` field into the finest-grained single-hop sub-questions.
   - Each sub-question must be independently executable; implicit multi-hop operations are strictly prohibited (e.g., "the birthday of X's director" must be split into two sub-questions: "X's director" and "[Director]'s birthday").
        
2. Dependency Modeling:
   - Use a DAG to clearly define the dependencies between sub-questions.
   - Downstream tasks must explicitly reference upstream results using `{{i.output}}` (e.g., if Question 2 depends on Question 1, the query for Question 2 must include `{{1.output}}`).
        
3. Output Specification:
   - The `example` field provides a sample query and the expected output (in the `output` field). Strictly follow the output format and provide your response in JSON format.
