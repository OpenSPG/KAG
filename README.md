# 1. What is KAG?

KAG is a logical reasoning and Q&A framework based on the [OpenSPG](https://github.com/OpenSPG/openspg) engine and large language models, which is used to build logical reasoning and Q&A solutions for vertical domain knowledge bases.  KAG can effectively overcome the ambiguity of traditional RAG vector similarity calculation and the noise problem of GraphRAG introduced by OpenIE.  KAG supports logical reasoning and multi-hop fact Q&A, etc., and is significantly better than the current SOTA method.

The goal of KAG is to build a knowledge-enhanced LLM service framework in professional domains, supporting logical reasoning, factual Q&A, etc. KAG fully integrates the logical and factual characteristics of the KGs. Its core features include:

- Knowledge and Chunk Mutual Indexing structure to integrate more complete contextual text information
- Knowledge alignment using conceptual semantic reasoning to alleviate the noise problem caused by OpenIE
- Schema-constrained knowledge construction to support the representation and construction of domain expert knowledge
- Logical form-guided hybrid reasoning and retrieval to support logical reasoning and multi-hop reasoning Q&A

# 2. Core Features

## 2.1 Knowledge Representation

In the context of private knowledge bases, unstructured data, structured information, and business expert experience often coexist. KAG references the DIKW hierarchy to upgrade SPG to a version that is friendly to LLMs. 

For unstructured data such as news, events, logs, and books, as well as structured data like transactions, statistics, and approvals, along with business experience and domain knowledge rules, KAG employs techniques such as layout analysis, knowledge extraction, property normalization, and semantic alignment to integrate raw business data and expert rules into a unified business knowledge graph.

![KAG Diagram](./_static/images/kag-diag.jpg)

This makes it compatible with schema-free information extraction and schema-constrained expertise construction on the same knowledge type (e. G., entity type, event type), and supports the cross-index representation between the graph structure and the original text block. 

This mutual index representation is helpful to the construction of inverted index based on graph structure, and promotes the unified representation and reasoning of logical forms.

## 2.2 Mixed Reasoning Guided by Logic Forms

![Logical Form Solver](./_static/images/kag-lf-solver.png)

KAG proposes a logically formal guided hybrid solution and inference engine. 

The engine includes three types of operators: planning, reasoning, and retrieval, which transform natural language problems into problem solving processes that combine language and notation. 

In this process, each step can use different operators, such as exact match retrieval, text retrieval, numerical calculation or semantic reasoning, so as to realize the integration of four different problem solving processes: Retrieval, Knowledge Graph reasoning, language reasoning and numerical calculation.

# 4. Quick Start

## 4.1 product-based (for ordinary users)

### 4.1.1 Engine & Dependent Image Installation

* **Recommend System Version:**

  ```text
  macOS UserÔºömacOS Monterey 12.6 or later
  Linux UserÔºöCentOS 7 / Ubuntu 20.04 or later
  Windows UserÔºöWindows 10 LTSC 2021 or later
  ```

* **Software Requirements:**

  ```

Use the following commands to download the docker-compose.yml file and launch the services with Docker Compose.

```bash
# set the HOME environment variable (only Windows users need to execute this command)
# set HOME=%USERPROFILE%

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSPG/openspg/refs/heads/master/dev/release/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 4.1.2 Use the product

Navigate to the default url of the KAG product with your browser: <http://127.0.0.1:8887>

See the [Product](https://openspg.yuque.com/ndx6g9/wc9oyq/rgd8ecefccwd1ga5) guide for detailed introduction.

## 4.2 toolkit-based (for developers)

### 4.2.1 Engine & Dependent Image Installation

Refer to the 3.1 section to complete the installation of the engine & dependent image.

### 4.2.2 Installation of KAG


**macOS / Linux developers**

```text
# Create conda env: conda create -n kag-demo python=3.10 && conda activate kag-demo

# Clone code: git clone https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.git

# Install KAG: cd KAG && pip install -e .
```

**Windows developers**

```text
# Install the official Python 3.8.10 or later, install Git.

# Create and activate Python venv: py -m venv kag-demo && kag-demo\Scripts\activate

# Clone code: git clone https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.git

# Install KAG: cd KAG && pip install -e .
```

### 4.2.3 Use the toolkit

Please refer to the [Quick Start](https://openspg.yuque.com/ndx6g9/wc9oyq/owp4sxbdip2u7uvv) guide for detailed introduction of the toolkit. Then you can use the built-in components to reproduce the performance results of the built-in datasets, and apply those components to new busineness scenarios.

# 5. Technical Architecture

![KAG technical architecture](./_static/images/kag-arch.png)

The KAG framework includes three parts: kg-builder, kg-solver, and kag-model. This release only involves the first two parts, kag-model will be gradually open source release in the future.

kg-builder implements a knowledge representation that is friendly to large-scale language models (LLM). Based on the hierarchical structure of DIKW (data, information, knowledge and wisdom), IT upgrades SPG knowledge representation ability, and is compatible with information extraction without schema constraints and professional knowledge construction with schema constraints on the same knowledge type (such as entity type and event type), it also supports the mutual index representation between the graph structure and the original text block, which supports the efficient retrieval of the reasoning question and answer stage.

kg-solver uses a logical symbol-guided hybrid solving and reasoning engine that includes three types of operators: planning, reasoning, and retrieval, to transform natural language problems into a problem-solving process that combines language and symbols. In this process, each step can use different operators, such as exact match retrieval, text retrieval, numerical calculation or semantic reasoning, so as to realize the integration of four different problem solving processes: Retrieval, Knowledge Graph reasoning, language reasoning and numerical calculation.
